This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with React to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here. -->

<!-- # Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing C9 developers adopt it? Is
this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod? Should we coordinate with
other projects or libraries? -->

<!-- # How we teach this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing C9 projects patterns?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the C9 documentation must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how C9 is taught to new developers
at any level?

How should this feature be taught to existing C9 developers? -->
